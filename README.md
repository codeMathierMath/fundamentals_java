# Java Fundamentals

This repository collects a small set of Java programs written to
develop and demonstrate core computer science fundamentals.

The emphasis is on **clarity, correctness, and conceptual understanding**
rather than production-level abstraction or performance optimization.

---

## Organization

Source files are grouped by the primary concept they explore.

src/
├── randomness/
│ ├── ProceduralSpaceScene.java
│ └── AnimatedStateEvolution.java



Each program focuses on a narrow set of ideas and is kept intentionally
small in scope.

## Scope and Intent

This repository is meant to serve as:
- a reference for foundational Java and CS concepts
- evidence of deliberate, incremental learning
- a complement to larger standalone projects

It is **not** intended to be:
- a library
- a framework
- a collection of polished applications

More complex or system-level projects are maintained in separate
repositories.

## Notes

Some programs in this repository originated as early coursework and were
later cleaned up and reorganized for clarity. Later work explores more
data-driven and extensible approaches.
